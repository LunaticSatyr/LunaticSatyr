👋 Hi, I’m @LunaticSatyr.
    I uhm... didn't do my research thoroughly when selecting a major to study in university,
    and has only discovered what programming is after I finished my studies.
    I'm now a newly converted programming enthusiast, and I'm grateful that
    I discovered where my passion lies at this not-so-late stage of life. 🤭

🌱 Inspired to be a full-stack web dev, I’m currently learning JavaScript / HTML5 / CSS3.
    I have basic knowledge about Java and Python, and have experience writing program using C++.
    
👀 I’m interested in hmm... anything tactical I would say, tactical TV series, shows, or games,
    particularly multiplayer games which I get to outwit my opponents.
    Apart from those, I hold highly of logic and rationality,
    and I enjoy classical music and table tennis.
    
💞️ I'm creating this GitHub profile as a step in looking for jobs,
    also planning to store my projects in the repository.
    
📫 You may contact me at kuangsmki@gmail.com, and I'll respond to you immediately.
    Thank you for reading up to this point. Stay safe, and stay entertained. 😄
